# ESCAPE ROOM FOR CGHS FINAL MINI PROJECT

## Info:

* ### This was entirely made on 05/21/25' , so errors are possible.
* ### This program uses two scripts. One script is the framework, and the other is an example. 
    * #### The first file is the module. This module can be used to make an infinite amount of different escape rooms
    * ####  The second of the two files is main.py. This file is an example of what can be made with the module.
        * #####   NOTE: Because of the severe time crunch, the module has some parts unique to the example; however not only are these really easy to supplement, they can be overridden with variables.
* ### To run this project, you'll need to download this repository as a folder.
* ### To play you will also need to have python installed --Old should work too
* ### Once installed, simply press on the Run.bat file to play!

## This Game was made in one day because the test game was taking too long to produce.
### Visit that games repository here : [Escape Room 2](https://github.com/B0ussi/Escape-Room)
#### --If you're mr. healy, you might find that one interesting.
